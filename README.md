# Fraud Detection of Illegal Accounts over the Ethereum Blockchain using Machine Learning and Neural Networks

## Project overview

This repository implements methods for detecting illegal or malicious accounts on the Ethereum blockchain using a combination of classical machine learning and neural network techniques. The project covers data collection, feature engineering, model training, evaluation, and result visualization.

## Key features

- Feature extraction from blockchain transaction and account data.
- Data preprocessing and handling of class imbalance.
- Baseline machine learning models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost).
- Neural network models (e.g., MLP, possibly LSTM/GNN exploration).
- Training and evaluation pipelines with metrics (precision, recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC).
- Reproducible experiments and example notebooks/scripts.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project consists of labeled Ethereum accounts with features derived from transaction history, balance, contract interactions, and other on-chain signals. If the raw data is not included in this repository, please refer to the project notes or data source scripts in the `data/` or `scripts/` folder.

If you are using an external dataset, place it in the data/ directory with the following structure:

- data/
  - raw/               # original, immutable data dump
  - processed/         # cleaned and feature-engineered data used for model training

## Setup

1. Clone the repository:

   git clone https://github.com/Pratik-Chakraborty/FRAUD-DETECTION-OF-ILLEGAL-ACCOUNTS-OVER-THE-ETHEREUM-BLOCKCHAIN-USING-MACHINE-LEARNING-AND-NEURAL-N.git
   cd FRAUD-DETECTION-OF-ILLEGAL-ACCOUNTS-OVER-THE-ETHEREUM-BLOCKCHAIN-USING-MACHINE-LEARNING-AND-NEURAL-N

2. Create a Python virtual environment (recommended) and install dependencies:

   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate   # macOS/Linux
   venv\Scripts\activate    # Windows

   pip install -r requirements.txt

If no requirements.txt exists, typical packages used in this project include:

- numpy
- pandas
- scikit-learn
- xgboost
- tensorflow or torch (for neural nets)
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- jupyterlab

## Usage

### Notebooks

- notebooks/ : Example Jupyter notebooks demonstrating data exploration, model training, and evaluation. Open these in JupyterLab or Jupyter Notebook.

### Scripts

- src/data_preprocessing.py  : Scripts to convert raw blockchain data into ML-ready feature tables.
- src/train_model.py        : Entry point to train classical ML models.
- src/train_nn.py           : Entry point to train neural network models.
- src/evaluate.py           : Evaluation and metrics scripts.
- src/predict.py            : Inference script to run a trained model on new accounts.

### Running a training experiment (example):

   python src/train_model.py --config configs/experiment1.yaml

### Training a neural network (example):

   python src/train_nn.py --config configs/nn_experiment.yaml

## Evaluation

Evaluate a saved model:

   python src/evaluate.py --model-path models/best_model.pkl --data data/processed/test.csv

### Model outputs

- models/ : Trained model artifacts (pickle, joblib, or saved model format).
- results/ : Evaluation reports, confusion matrices, and figures.

## Reproducibility

- Set random seeds in the training scripts to ensure reproducibility.
- Use configuration files in configs/ to track hyperparameters.
